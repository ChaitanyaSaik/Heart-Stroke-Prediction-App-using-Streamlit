# Heart-Stroke-Prediction-App-using-Streamlit
Created an heart stroke prediction using streamlit and machine learning models 
I'm thrilled to share my project: Heart Stroke Prediction using Machine Learning & Streamlit! 🔍📊

With a streamlined manual data preprocessing pipeline, this application enables accurate stroke risk assessment based on medical data. Built using Python & OpenCV, it offers an interactive UI with real-time data insights to help users understand key risk factors.

🔥 Key Features:
✅ Real-time stroke prediction using machine learning
✅ Manual data preprocessing for better control & transparency
✅ Interactive visualizations to explore risk factors
✅ Class imbalance handling using SMOTE for fair model performance

🛠 Technologies Used:
🔹 Python
🔹 Streamlit
🔹 Scikit-learn
🔹 Pandas & NumPy

💡 Potential Applications:
🎯 Healthcare analytics for stroke prevention
📊 Medical research & risk assessment
🏥 AI-powered decision support for doctors

This project is a step forward in predictive healthcare, leveraging machine learning and data analytics to enhance early stroke detection! 🚀🔬
